👋 Hi, I’m Andrew — a Junior DevOps Engineer passionate about cloud-native development and automation.

🔧 I recently built and deployed a production-grade sentiment analysis app using:
- 🐳 Docker for full containerization  
- ⚙️ FastAPI (Python) as the backend framework  
- ☁️ AWS Comprehend for NLP & CodePipeline for CI/CD  
- 🔐 Secrets managed via AWS ENV vars during Docker runtime  
- 🧪 Jenkins & GitHub Actions for hands-on CI/CD experimentation  
- 🐧 Comfortable in Linux environments  
- 📦 Now diving deeper into Kubernetes!

🚀 My learning is **project-driven** — everything I do is deployed and version-controlled.

🔍 Currently open to **remote DevOps roles**, internships, or collaborative open-source projects.
